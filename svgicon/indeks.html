        <blockquote>
            <p>A minifier removes the comments and unnecessary whitespace from a program. Depending on how the program is written, this can reduce the size by about half. An obfuscator also minifies, but it will also make modifications to the program, changing
                the names of variables, functions, and members, making the program much harder to understand, and further reducing its size in the bargain.</p><small><a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/03/06/minification-v-obfuscation/">Minification vs Obfuscation</a></small></blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>When we talk of style here, we are not talking about fads and fashions, nor are we talking about CSS or conventions of layout or typography. We are talking about timeless qualities of expression which can substantially increase the value of
                a codebase. For companies whose valuations are are inextricably bound to their codebases, style should be a vital concern.</p><small>The Elements of JavaScript Style [ <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/style1.html">Part 1</a> | <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/style2.html">Part 2</a> ]</small></blockquote>
